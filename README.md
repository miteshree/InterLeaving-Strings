# InterLeaving-Strings
The problem gives three strings s1, s2, and s3, find out whether s3 is formed by the interleaving of s1 and s2. 
The crux of the problem is to understand the "interleaving". Basically, we can understand the problem by s2 is formed by 
connecting s1 and s2 together. The way of connecting could be interleaved.
